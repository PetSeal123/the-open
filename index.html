  <h2>📋 Game Rules</h2>
  <div id="game-rules">
    <p>Simple rules:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Pick any 3 golfers and number them your 1st, 2nd, and 3rd.</li>
      <li>Their combined placing number is your score.</li>
      <li>Lowest score wins!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      In the event of a tie, we’ll use your 1st pick’s last round score, then 2nd, then 3rd, working backward through the rounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have the same 3 golfers as someone else, I’ll message you with a tiebreaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winner takes all! If we get 10+ entries, we may add prizes for 2nd and 3rd.
